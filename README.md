👋 Hi, I’m @savvythunder, a budding bot developer!
👀 I’m interested in crafting bots that blur the lines between reality and code.
🌱 I’m currently learning the magical spells of Python and the enchanting incantations of JavaScript.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating bots that make Discord servers come alive!

⚡ Fun fact: I once coded a bot that told such good jokes, it got a laugh out of the error messages!
